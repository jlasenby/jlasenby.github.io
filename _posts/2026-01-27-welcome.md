# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is the first post in my digital garden. I'm using Jekyll and Obsidian to create a minimal, brutalist-style personal site.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technology and software
- Learning in public
- Ideas worth exploring
- Whatever captures my attention

This site is intentionally minimal—no distractions, just content.

## The Setup

Built with:
- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **Obsidian** as the content management system
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting
- **Brutalist design** principles for focus

More to come.
